If you are linked here, it is because your Facebook account has been "hacked". I'll
show you how to restore your Facebook account and make sure this doesn't happen again.

First step: Disable "apps"
==========================

Some security problems happen because of "apps" you accidentally or purposefully
added to Facebook. The first thing you need to do is delete the apps you don't use.

Click on the settings menu:

Then click on "Privacy Settings":

Click on "Apps":

![Facebook Settings: Settings page](/content/facebook-security/facebook-settings-page.png)

On the list of apps, delete the ones you don't know or don't use. Delete as many as possible:

When you delete an app make sure the box is checked, then click "Remove":

Enable HTTPS
============

This will make sure no rogue websites can "hack" your site again.

Go to the security page again and click on "Security":

![Facebook Settings: Security settings menu](/content/facebook-security/security-settings-menu.png)

Then click on "Edit" under "Secure Browsing":

Check the box "Enable HTTPS" and hit "Save":

Check logged in devices
=======================

Make sure there are no devices logged in that you don't know about.

On "Recognized Devices" click on "Edit":

![Facebook Settings: Recognized devices](/content/facebook-security/security-settings-recognized-devices.png)

On the list of recognized devices, delete any that you don't know. It is better here to be safe than sorry: All that will happen is that you have to log in again on the device.

Check logged in sites
=====================

Make sure there are no sites logged in that you don't know about.

### Click on "Active Sessions" ###

![Facebook Settings: Logged in locations](/content/facebook-security/security-settings-logged-in-locations.png)

### Delete all of them ###

This means you'll have to sign back in on any devices, like your cell phone.

Change Password
===============

Although at this point you probably don't *need* to change your password, it may be a good idea
to go ahead and do it anyway.

### Go into the settings ###

### Edit password ###

### Change your password ###

Congratulations!
================

You just cleaned up your Facebook account!
