If you are linked here, it is because your Facebook account has been "hacked". I'll
show you how to restore your Facebook account and make sure this doesn't happen again.

## Disable "apps"

Some security problems happen because of "apps" you accidentally or purposefully
added to Facebook. The first thing you need to do is delete the apps you don't use.

Click on the settings menu:

![Facebook Settings: Menu](/content/images/facebook-security/facebook-settings-menu.png)

Then click on "Privacy Settings":

![Facebook Settings: Menu expanded](/content/images/facebook-security/facebook-settings-menu-expanded.png)

Click on "Apps":

![Facebook Settings: Settings page](/content/images/facebook-security/facebook-settings-page.png)

On the list of apps, delete the ones you don't know or don't use. Delete as many as possible:

When you delete an app make sure the box is checked, then click "Remove":

## Enable HTTPS

This will make sure no rogue websites can "hack" your site again.

Go to the security page again and click on "Security":

![Facebook Settings: Security settings menu](/content/images/facebook-security/security-settings-menu.png)

Then click on "Edit" under "Secure Browsing":

![Facebook Settings: Security settings menu edit](/content/images/facebook-security/security-settings-menu-edit.png)

Check the box "Enable HTTPS" and hit "Save":

## Check for logged in devices

Make sure nobody is logged in to your account that you don't know about.

On "Recognized Devices" click on "Edit":

![Facebook Settings: Recognized devices](/content/images/facebook-security/security-settings-recognized-devices.png)

On the list of recognized devices, delete any that you don't know. It is better to be safe instead of sorry, so delete as many as you can!

(Deleting devices just means that you'll have to re-login on that device.)

## Check logged in sites

Sites can be "logged in" on your account, so delete the ones you don't know about.

Click on "Active Sessions":

![Facebook Settings: Logged in locations](/content/images/facebook-security/security-settings-logged-in-locations.png)

Delete all of the sessions. This just means you'll have to sign back in on things like your cell phone.

## Change Password

At this point, since you're worried about security, it's a good idea to change your password.

Go into the settings:

![Facebook Settings: General](/content/images/facebook-security/facebook-settings-general.png)

Edit password:

![Facebook Settings: Password](/content/images/facebook-security/facebook-settings-password.png)

Change your password:

![Facebook Settings: Password change](/content/images/facebook-security/facebook-settings-password-change.png)


## Congratulations!

You just cleaned up your Facebook account!
