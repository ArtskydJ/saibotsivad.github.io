Hey there.

My online presence:

* [@saibotsivad](https://twitter.com/saibotsivad) on Twitter
* A handful of packages [on npm](https://www.npmjs.org/~saibotsivad)
* Some attempts at making [useful things](https://github.com/tobiaslabs)
* Some [personal repos](https://github.com/saibotsivad)
* I'm trying out [keybase](https://keybase.io/saibotsivad)
* Here and there online in other places

Some projects that I put together:

* [hex2words](http://tobiaslabs.com/hex2words/) is a simple JS
  tool utilizing the [PGP word list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP_word_list)
* The [SDMP](https://github.com/tobiaslabs/SDMP) is my attempt
  at making the internet a better, more secure place
* Not being satisfied with the language of the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/) or
  the restrictions of the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), I made
  my [own license](http://veryopenlicense.com/)

On the left you can see some things I wrote.

I hope they are useful or interesting.
