Hi there!

* This is the official open library of projects started by
	[Tobias Davis (saibotsivad)](http://davistobias.com).
* You can track progress of Tobias Labs projects on the
	[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/xTCO0Lax/tobias-labs).
* You can get involved by making pull requests to any of the repositories.
* I (try to) follow [rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg)'s
	[OPEN Open Source](https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
	model.
* All the code and documentation made public on this site is released under the
  [Very Open License](http://veryopenlicense.com).

Although you can check out the [complete repository list](https://github.com/tobiaslabs), here
is a shortened list of all the projects hosted here:

* [npmupdater](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npmupdater-cli) is a way to make it
	easier to check and update [npm](http://www.npmjs.com) modules.
* [hex2words](http://tobiaslabs.com/hex2words/) is a simple JS tool utilizing the
	[PGP word list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP_word_list) to verify hashes.
* The [Very Open License](http://veryopenlicense.com/) is for people and businesses who are
  uncomfortable with "The Swears" in the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/), but want something
  even simpler and *less* restrictive than the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
* The [SDMP](http://sdmp.io/) is my attempt at making the internet a better, more secure place.
