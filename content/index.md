Hey there. I'm terribly sorry, while trying to switch over to using [noddity](http://noddity.com) I managed to mess up my DNS settings and switched the whole site over to the new version before it was done.

There's not alot here. There's also not a lot here.

Sorry.

Come back later, maybe?

I'm working on fixing all the posts as fast as I can, I do apologize for all the broken things hanging about!
