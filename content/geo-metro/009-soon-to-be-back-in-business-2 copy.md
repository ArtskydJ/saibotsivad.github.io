Alright, I finally got some work lined up, and some big money coming in, so I will be back on board for working on this project in a couple weeks. I will also get a camera, so I can show you the stuff I have done so far.

Fuel economy over the winter suffered, it was about 35 mpg, even dropping at one point to somewhere near 32 mpg. I thought it was perhaps the light-car-on-snow dilemma, but now I am noticing the clutch slips quite a bit so I guess that is probably it. Right now I am doing 42-44 mpg range, but when I change out the transmission in a couple weeks I think I could get 50+ mpg.

As soon as I have the transmission swapped, I will begin working on the interior and on some newly forming rust spots outside. Hopefully I will have the whole thing sealed up pretty well in preparation for winter, but I hope to get even more than that done this summer/early fall.

For fun, here is a list of modifications I plan on making, in a mostly linear fashion:

* Swap transmission: Old one grinds into third, plus parts are hard to get, being so old, so I am putting in a '94
* Fuel meter: Some sort of fuel economy measurer, I want to be able to export the data to my computer easily.
* Exterior rust protection: There are only a few spots of rust, surprisingly, so I want to clean up those and prevent new ones.
* Interior rust protection: The inside has quite a few spots of surface rust, I want to take care of those.
* Interior decorating: Right now all the carpet has been stripped out, and the seats are ugly (and slightly smelly)
* Rear wheel well covers: Some people say it looks like a space ship, but the fuel economy is much better (roughly +5 mpg on mine).
* Front wheel covers: Much harder to make, but can add significant fuel economy, as well as weird looks.
* Front grill cover: I have sketched out some ideas for a better air intake mechanism for cooling, it will make the front end a lot smoother.
* Underpan: This will be made in multiple pieces for easier under car access, I hope to install the basic ones this summer.

I also am getting another Geo engine, which I will rebuild slowly, adding some modifications which I have designed to improve performance.

See you in a couple weeks!
