Well, not much to report here: School is out in a few weeks, then things should heat back up. The clutch started slipping, along with third gear grinding really bad, so that is my first mission when I am done with school this semester.

Over the summer I would like to make an aerodynamic fairing for my car, a lot like [this guys](http://ecomodder.com/forum/showthread.php/aerocivic-how-drop-your-cd-0-31-0-a-290.html):
