[Sermon Posts](https://github.com/tobiaslabs/sermon_posts) is a plugin for [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) that manages
sermons and sermon audio, along with preachers, services, and more!

This plugin was initially started as a replacement for the older [Sermon Browser](http://www.sermonbrowser.com/)
plugin, which has not had much updating done since 2009\. However, after the
project started, several handy features were added that make this version even better!

Some of the features are:

*   Manage preachers, series, and services.
*   A more natural file management screen.
*   View the MP3 tags on the site.
*   Edit the MP3 tags and set MP3 [album art](http://www.richardfarrar.com/embedding-album-art-in-mp3-files/) on the site. (Not done yet.)
*   Set MP3 tags from sermon information, or set sermon information from MP3 tags. (Not done yet.)
*   Ability to make custom template pages for pastors, series, and services.
*   Default WordPress search will look through sermon description and list sermons. (Not done yet.)
*   Set custom artwork for each sermon.
*   Admin side filtering the sermon files by preacher, series, or service.
*   Support the popular podcast feeds.
*   Import from the old Sermon Browser plugin.
