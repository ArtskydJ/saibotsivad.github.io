## Guiding Principles

* I want to always be learning new things.
* I value thinking outside the box to find the right solution.
* I want to make things that users care about.
* I want the things I make to be high quality.
* I want to work with other people who care about those same things.

## Best Fit

What I'm really interested in is making amazing and maintainable UI,
and building tools and interfaces that get used.

Being able to talk with the users is awesome, because it means I
can hear their complaints firsthand, and have a better idea of
what's important to them.

Using open source tools and not contributing back to the community
bothers me; I'd like to have time to contribute to tools that are
highly valued by the company.

## Professional Experience

### Developer for [eDataSource](http://www.edatasource.com/): 2012-present

The big picture view is that I help develop software for research
and analysis of ecommerce data, using aggregated data gathered from
a panel of over 1 million active users.

In my first couple years I primarily worked within an in-house custom built
framework to design tools that analyzed third-party HTML documents in order
to parse out financial data. This aggregated data is used as a predictive
tool for financial investors.

However, in the most recent 2+ years I've been working on the webapp side
of the company; that's all AngularJS on the front end, and Java/Jetty/JAX-RS
on the back end.

I was the lead on a couple big and painful software upgrades (Bootstrap 2.2
to 3.3, AngularJS 1.1 to 1.3) and I'm pretty proud of how smoothly that went.

I think I'm pretty reasonable at writing AngularJS code, but I've also spent
a lot of time writing JS apart from Angular. I've made a handful of
[npm modules](https://www.npmjs.com/~saibotsivad), and I'm familiar with
the usual grunt/gulp/browserify/etc. type toolsets. (We use Grunt and
browserify for our webapps.)

Our backend is all Java, and I've written a lot of API endpoints and custom
tools in it, so I'd say I'm reasonably proficient in that language as well.
Specifically, we use Java 8, and (compared to Java 6) I'm pretty fond of it's
feature set.

Most of our servers/databases are run on AWS, and although I'm not the
sysadmin, we are a small enough group that I've had to become at least
familiar with all the big AWS offerings. We use SQS to pass around many
millions of messages per month, Aurora to hold terabyte sized databases,
EC2 to run our different webapps and various other tools, and S3 and Glacier
to store hundreds of millions of files. We haven't used AWS Lambdas yet,
but I'm itching to try them out.

## Familiar Technology

I've created tools and products using:

* MySQL
* JavaScript
* CSS
* node.js
* Java
* AngularJS
* Redis
* Ubuntu/Arch/Debian
* AWS: SQS/S3/EC2
* SQLite
* PHP
