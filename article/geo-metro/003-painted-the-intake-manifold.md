Here it is, naked. Rabbit Tracks ice cream, standing by.

With all that blue tape.

The manifold, with brown primer: Rustoleum special!

Not much news, except that I painted the intake manifold today. It is going to be a wonderful brown color. Ha ha! No way, man! That is just the primer, a Rustoleum special to be sure. Here you can see the intake before and after shots.

I used a foam brush applicator, mostly because of laziness, and it doesn't look too bad until you get it in bright light: I will probably use an airbrush to paint it the actual color.

Right now I am having a hard time deciding, but I think I will paint the intake manifold white and the throttle body red to match the head.

In the picture you will notice a small bowl and spoon, containing the necessity of life: Ice Cream! Delicious "Rabbit Tracks", although I would prefer some homemade chocolate fudge stuff.
