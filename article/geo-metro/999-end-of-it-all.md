title: The end of it all

I'm writing this at least a couple years after the event, so the memory is a little clouded.

With much sadness I had to junk the car.

The front suspension started having problems, they started the day the front passenger tire exploded while I was driving down the interstate. The poor thing suffered a lot of body damage, there's a big bundle of wires over that wheel that got ripped up, and it bent the A-arm.

I got it put back together but it never drove the same, and eventually, while driving to work one day, the front right suspension fell apart and I came to a screeching halt, metal parts ground into the... ground. Asphalt, really.

After that there wasn't much I could do. If I remember correctly, I sold it to the junk yard. Or it dissappeared. Or I burned it with fire.

It's hard to remember.
