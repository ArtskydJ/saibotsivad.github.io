Saturday, a few days ago, I finally received the long-awaited [Solidoodle](http://solidoodle.com/) 3D
printer in the mail. The box was well packed, with sufficient packing, and I was impressed with the
solid feel of the build.

I got it in the mail like this:

It was well secured in the package, and well packed with bubble wrap:

The printer is a basic angle-iron frame. It looks very utilitarian, definitely not a
polished product but very solid feeling:

A closer view of the extruder head:

After setting it up and being frustrated with Windows, it turns out I really just needed to do a better
job at reading Solidoodle's well written instructions.

I downloaded the archer figurine from the [Pocket Tactics](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:41740) game,
and set the printer to work. After a few tweaks to the heater temperature and the bed, this was produced:

There is some malforming of the plastic due to the feed temperature of the plastic being too high, but
overall I am reasonably well impressed with the detail work.

Overall I'm satisfied with the Solidoodle printer, it's a safe purchase if you have
the inclination to purchase a 3D printer.
