In the course of my work with WordPress, I've created quite a number of plugins to test and demonstrate particularly interesting things. In the past I tried to post them here on this blog, but it is rather time consuming to copy/paste into WordPress, make sure all the editing is correct, and upload the files. Right now I'm trying to wrap up several projects that I started during school, and start a few other projects that I feel will be very productive, so I don't really have time to do this anymore.

However, if you are interested in the WordPress related plugins I design, you can now [check them out on Github](https://github.com/saibotsivad)! I'll put each of the plugins under the naming convention "tlwp_" (Tobias Labs, WordPress) followed by the name of the plugin, which will be reasonably descriptive. I'll put in heavier-than-normal code comments, and hopefully you can figure things out well enough that way.

I think that I will also post a link and short (think Twitter-sized) post whenever I add a new plugin, so you can comment under that post if things aren't clear enough in the code, or if you have other related questions. You can also make pull requests etc. if you find errors in my code! Have a look at the first example, which is a custom post plugin, with custom permalink schema and custom icons included: [https://github.com/saibotsivad/tlwp_custom_post](https://github.com/saibotsivad/tlwp_custom_post)

You'll also notice the Sermon Posts plugin is residing there: [https://github.com/saibotsivad/sermon_posts](https://github.com/saibotsivad/sermon_posts) That project is coming along, now that school is over. At the rate of progress I am making, I hope to have a completed plugin within a month from now. I cut the importing functionality completely from the code, and I'll make a separate plugin that will handle that, this will make long-term maintenance easier.
